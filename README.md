# Rubik's Cube Solver

## Description
This project is a Rubik's Cube solver implemented in C++ using CLion. The virtual Rubik's Cube is modeled using a 3D array data structure. The main focus of this project is to apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C++.

## Features
- Rubik's Cube modeling: The Rubik's Cube is virtually represented using a 3D array data structure to store the cube's state.
- Depth-First Search (DFS) Solver: The solver uses a depth-first search algorithm to find a solution to the Rubik's Cube. It explores the solution space by trying different moves and backtracking when necessary.
- Breadth-First Search (BFS) Solver: The solver uses a breadth-first search algorithm to find a solution to the Rubik's Cube. It systematically explores all possible moves and their resulting states to find the shortest solution.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the project in CLion.
3. Build and compile the project(main.cpp) using the C++ compiler.

## Usage
1. Run the compiled executable file.
2. Uncomment the solving algorithm (DFS or BFS).
3. The cube gets randomly jumbled.
4. The program will find a solution and display the steps to solve the Rubik's Cube.

## Dependencies
This project has no external dependencies. It is developed using C++ only, utilizing the standard library.

## Contributions
Contributions to this project are welcome! If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to create a pull request or open an issue.

## Credits
The Rubik's Cube solver algorithm is based on existing algorithms and concepts in the field of Rubik's Cube solving.
